# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-22)

**Core value:** Correctness, performance, and completeness with no compromises
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Platform Foundation (COMPLETE)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Platform Foundation) - COMPLETE
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (all complete)
Status: Phase complete, ready for Phase 2
Last activity: 2026-01-22 - Completed 01-03-PLAN.md (Message bus error handling)

Progress: [====------] 10% (3/30 plans estimated)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 9 min
- Total execution time: 26 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 3 | 26 min | 9 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-03 (6m), 01-02 (5m), 01-01 (15m)
- Trend: Improving (faster execution as codebase familiarity increases)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Drop Windows support: Focus on Linux/macOS platforms only
- Generic S3 API: Single implementation supports AWS, MinIO, R2, Backblaze, GCS
- Full observability: Enterprise-ready monitoring with metrics, tracing, health endpoints
- SDK parity: All five languages must have same features and quality
- No graceful degradation: Demand resources, expose problems through metrics/traces

From 01-03:
- ConnectionResetByPeer treated as normal peer disconnect, not error
- Peer eviction logs at WARN level (was info)
- Resource exhaustion continues accepting (OS backpressure)
- State machine already well-guarded (26 assertions), no changes needed

From 01-02:
- F_FULLFSYNC validated once at startup, cached for all subsequent sync calls
- Startup fails immediately with actionable error if filesystem doesn't support F_FULLFSYNC
- macOS objcopy uses aarch64 binary for all architectures (Rosetta handles x86_64)

From 01-01:
- Windows support completely removed from build targets
- io.zig hub emits compile error for unsupported platforms
- time.zig simplified to Darwin/Linux only

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

From CONCERNS.md - key issues to address:
- S3 upload stub in replication.zig:828 (Phase 4)
- Disk spillover stub in replication.zig:218 (Phase 4)
- VSR snapshot verification disabled (Phase 2)
- ~~Darwin fsync safety concern (Phase 1)~~ RESOLVED in 01-02
- ~~macOS x86_64 test assertion (Phase 1)~~ RESOLVED in 01-02
- ~~Message bus error handling TODOs (Phase 1)~~ RESOLVED in 01-03
