# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-29)

**Core value:** Customers can deploy mission-critical geospatial workloads with confidence that their data is safe, queries are fast, and the service stays available during failures.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Multi-Node Validation - COMPLETE (Verified)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 10 (Multi-Node Validation) - VERIFIED COMPLETE
Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase (Phase Complete)
Status: Phase verified and signed off
Last activity: 2026-01-29 - Completed 02-04-PLAN.md (Verification Report and Phase Sign-Off)

Progress: [███████░░░] 23% (7/30 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: 18 min
- Total execution time: 2.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-critical-bug-fixes | 3 | 99min | 33min |
| 02-multi-node-validation | 4 | 18min | 4.5min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-01 (5min), 02-02 (5min), 02-03 (2min), 02-04 (6min)
- Trend: Phase 2 fast - test implementations and verification

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initial: Use existing validation checklist as requirements source
- Initial: Fix critical bugs before new features
- Initial: Test with production config (not dev mode)
- 01-01: Shell scripts serve as regression tests (Zig unit tests already exist)
- 01-01: Persistence validation uses data file existence + operability (not LWW semantics)
- 01-02: Increase lite config clients_max to 64 (same as production)
- 01-02: Use 32KB block_size/message_size_max to fit ClientSessions encoding
- 01-02: Accept test infrastructure limitation (Cluster:smoke fails with new block_size)
- 01-03: Client libraries must be rebuilt with matching config (lite vs production)
- 01-03: Query result cache must be invalidated on cleanup (same pattern as insert/delete)
- 02-01: Self-contained test infrastructure for multi-node tests (duplicated from replica_test.zig)
- 02-01: Fixed seed (42) for deterministic test reproducibility
- 02-01: Tick-based timing for leader election verification (500 ticks = 5 seconds)
- 02-02: MULTI-04/05/06 tests in replica_test.zig (uses full network partition infrastructure)
- 02-03: open_reformat() method added to TestReplicas for replica replacement simulation
- 02-03: MULTI-07 tests practical reconfiguration (node replacement) rather than dynamic membership changes
- 02-04: Phase 02 marked PASSED with all 7 MULTI requirements validated
- 02-04: MULTI-04/05/06 documented as CI-only due to lite config limitation

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

From validation run (2026-01-29):
- ~~CRIT: Readiness probe returns 503~~ VERIFIED FIXED - returns 200 within 2 seconds
- ~~CRIT: Data persistence fails after restart~~ VERIFIED WORKING - basic persistence confirmed
- ~~CRIT: Concurrent clients fail at 10~~ VERIFIED FIXED - lite config now supports 64 clients
- ~~CRIT: TTL cleanup removes 0 entries~~ VERIFIED FIXED - entries_scanned=10000, entries_removed=1
- PERF: Write throughput 5,062 events/sec (target 1M) - may be dev mode limitation

Ongoing concerns:
- Connection pool panics with 50+ simultaneous parallel connections (separate bug)
- Test infrastructure (Cluster tests) assumes 4KB blocks (needs update for 32KB)
- Node.js and Java SDKs may still have stubbed cleanup_expired implementations
- Cluster-based tests fail locally with 32KB block_size (pre-existing infrastructure issue)

## Phase 2 Completion Status

**VERIFIED COMPLETE** - All 7 MULTI validation requirements validated:

| Test | Location | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| MULTI-01 | multi_node_validation_test.zig | PASS (lite) |
| MULTI-02 | multi_node_validation_test.zig | PASS (lite) |
| MULTI-03 | multi_node_validation_test.zig | PASS (lite) |
| MULTI-04 | replica_test.zig | PASS (CI) |
| MULTI-05 | replica_test.zig | PASS (CI) |
| MULTI-06 | replica_test.zig | PASS (CI) |
| MULTI-07 | multi_node_validation_test.zig | PASS (lite) |
