## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Drop Windows support: Focus on Linux/macOS platforms only
- Generic S3 API: Single implementation supports AWS, MinIO, R2, Backblaze, GCS
- Full observability: Enterprise-ready monitoring with metrics, tracing, health endpoints
- SDK parity: All five languages must have same features and quality
- No graceful degradation: Demand resources, expose problems through metrics/traces

From 01-02:
- F_FULLFSYNC validated once at startup, cached for all subsequent sync calls
- Startup fails immediately with actionable error if filesystem doesn't support F_FULLFSYNC
- macOS objcopy uses aarch64 binary for all architectures (Rosetta handles x86_64)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

From CONCERNS.md - key issues to address:
- S3 upload stub in replication.zig:828 (Phase 4)
- Disk spillover stub in replication.zig:218 (Phase 4)
- VSR snapshot verification disabled (Phase 2)
- ~~Darwin fsync safety concern (Phase 1)~~ RESOLVED in 01-02
- ~~macOS x86_64 test assertion (Phase 1)~~ RESOLVED in 01-02
